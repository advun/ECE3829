This class uses the Baysys 3 Board, which uses the Artix-7, XC7A35T-1CPG236C.  You can find this on Vivado as the xc7a35tcpg236-1 device.

Each lab should have the cooresponding assignments in a .XDC file, but if not, the master doc is at https://github.com/Digilent/digilent-xdc/blob/master/Basys-3-Master.xdc

Copy the correct assignments for the I/O used into a constraints file.  Also, copy the CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAG found at the bottom of the master doc.
